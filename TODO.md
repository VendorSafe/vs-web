## Required Model Updates

### TrainingProgram Enhancements
```ruby
class TrainingProgram < ApplicationRecord
  # Add Vue.js player support
  has_many :training_contents, -> { order(position: :asc) }
  has_many :training_invitations
  has_many :training_progress_records
  has_many :certificates

  # Enhanced state management
  include WorkflowActiverecord
  workflow_column :state
  workflow do
    state :draft do
      event :publish, transitions_to: :published
    end
    state :published do
      event :archive, transitions_to: :archived
    end
    state :archived
  end

  # Progress tracking
  def calculate_progress(user)
    progress_records.where(user: user).sum(:completion_percentage) / training_contents.count
  end

  # Certificate management
  def generate_certificate(user)
    return unless completed_by?(user)
    certificates.create!(
      user: user,
      issued_at: Time.current,
      expires_at: certificate_expiration_date
    )
  end
end
```
