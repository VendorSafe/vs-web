## File Editing Workflow

When making multiple edits to related files, it's more efficient to:

1. **Read all relevant files first:** Use a script to read the contents of all target files into memory.
2. **Make edits individually:** Use separate `apply_diff` or `write_to_file` requests for each file, referencing the in-memory content.

This avoids redundant file reads and improves overall speed, especially when dealing with many small changes across multiple files.
