#
# == State Management
# Current implementation uses workflow_activerecord for state management:
# - draft: Initial state for new programs
# - published: Program is live and available to users
# - archived: Program is no longer active
#
# TODO: Implement additional state features:
# - Add validation for required fields before publishing
# - Add state-specific scopes for easier querying
# - Implement state change notifications
#
# == Progress Tracking
# Progress is tracked through training_memberships and training_progress tables:
# - training_memberships: Overall progress for a user
# - training_progress: Detailed progress for each content item
#
# TODO: Implement progress tracking:
# - Add methods to calculate overall progress
# - Implement completion criteria validation
# - Add progress update callbacks
# - Add completion notifications
#
# == Certificate Management
# Certificates are managed through training_certificates table with:
# - Validity period tracking
# - Custom certificate fields
# - Template management
#
# TODO: Implement certificate features:
# - Add certificate generation service
# - Implement expiration notifications
# - Add certificate verification endpoints
# - Add certificate template management
#
# == Content Organization
# Content is managed through training_contents and training_questions tables:
# - training_contents: Main content items (videos, documents, etc.)
# - training_questions: Assessment questions
#
# TODO: Implement content features:
# - Add content type validation
# - Implement content ordering
# - Add content prerequisites
# - Add content visibility rules
#
# == Activity Tracking
# TODO: Re-enable and implement activity tracking:
# - Enable PublicActivity tracking
# - Add custom activity types
# - Implement activity filters
# - Add activity notifications
