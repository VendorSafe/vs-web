- ◯ Document any inconsistencies between original spec and current implementation

## Key Findings

### Original System Concept

The original Udoras system was designed as a training management platform with a multi-role architecture focused on:

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Four distinct user roles with hierarchical permissions:
   - **Admin**: System administrators with full access
   - **Customer**: Organizations creating and managing training programs
   - **Vendor**: Team managers with employee management capabilities
   - **Employee**: Individual team members taking training

2. **Training Management Workflow**:
   - Customers could create training requests
   - Vendors could assign training to employees
   - Employees could complete training and earn certificates
   - Admins could oversee the entire process

3. **Certificate Management System**:
   - Generation of certificates upon training completion
   - Verification and sharing capabilities
   - Expiration tracking

4. **User Interface Design**:
   - Simple, form-based interfaces
   - Table-based data presentation
   - Basic search and pagination

### Current Implementation Enhancements

The current implementation has significantly expanded on the original concept:

1. **Enhanced Role System**:
   - More sophisticated role-based permissions
   - Team-based access control
   - Integration with Bullet Train's built-in team system

2. **Advanced Training Program Features**:
   - State management with workflow transitions (draft, published, archived)
   - Progress tracking with completion percentage
   - Sequential content progression

3. **Sophisticated Certificate System**:
   - PDF generation with custom styling
   - QR code verification
   - Expiration handling
   - Revocation capabilities

4. **Modern Frontend**:
   - Vue.js training program player
   - Interactive content viewer
   - Progress visualization
   - Responsive design

5. **Additional Features Not in Original Spec**:
   - Activity tracking system
   - API endpoints for integration
   - Comprehensive test infrastructure
   - Advanced reporting capabilities

## ERD Generation Issues

The following issues were identified when generating the Entity-Relationship Diagram:

```
[WARN] table PublicActivity::ORM::ActiveRecord::Activity doesn't exist. Skipping PublicActivity::Activity#parameters's serialization
Loading application environment...
Loading code in search of Active Record models...
Generating Entity-Relationship Diagram for 40 models...
Warning: Ignoring invalid model PublicActivity::Activity (table activities does not exist)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :trackable on PublicActivity::ORM::ActiveRecord::Activity (polymorphic interface Trackable does not exist)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :owner on PublicActivity::ORM::ActiveRecord::Activity (polymorphic interface Owner does not exist)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :recipient on PublicActivity::ORM::ActiveRecord::Activity (polymorphic interface Recipient does not exist)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :event_type on Webhooks::Outgoing::Event (model Webhooks::Outgoing::EventType exists, but is not included in domain)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :country on Address (model Addresses::Country exists, but is not included in domain)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :region on Address (model Addresses::Region exists, but is not included in domain)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :training_completions on User (Missing model class TrainingCompletion for the User#training_completions association. You can specify a different model class with the :class_name option.)
Warning: Ignoring invalid association :completed_training_contents on User (Missing model class TrainingCompletion for the User#training_completions association. You can specify a different model class with the :class_name option.)
```

### ERD Issues to Fix

- Create activities table for PublicActivity::ORM::ActiveRecord::Activity
- Fix polymorphic interfaces for Trackable, Owner, and Recipient
- Include Webhooks::Outgoing::EventType in domain
- Include Addresses::Country and Addresses::Region in domain
- Create TrainingCompletion model or fix associations on User model

## Conclusion

The analysis of the original Udoras specifications provides valuable context for understanding the evolution of the VendorSafe training platform. The current implementation represents a significant advancement over the original concept, with modern technologies, expanded capabilities, and improved user experience.

Several key features from the original specification have been enhanced and expanded, while new features have been added to meet evolving requirements. The implementation plan outlines the steps needed to complete the remaining work and address identified issues.

The ERD generation issues indicate some inconsistencies in the database schema and model associations that need to be addressed to ensure proper documentation and understanding of the system architecture.
