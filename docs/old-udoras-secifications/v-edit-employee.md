## Overview

This wireframe displays the "Edit Employee" interface from the vendor perspective. It allows vendors to modify an existing employee's information in the system.

## UI Components

### Navigation Header
- **Logo**: Organization or application logo in the top-left corner
- **Main Navigation**: Horizontal menu with options for Training Requests and Certificates
- **User Profile**: Icon in the top-right corner for accessing user account options
- **Navigation Arrow**: Button in the top-right corner for additional navigation options

### Form Header
- **Title**: "Edit Employee" heading centered at the top of the form

### Employee Information Form
- **Name Field**: Required text input (marked with asterisk *) for the employee's name
- **Email Field**: Required text input (marked with asterisk *) for the employee's email address
- **Phone Number Field**: Required text input (marked with asterisk *) for the employee's phone number

### Form Controls
- **Save Button**: Button at the bottom to submit the form and save the employee changes

### Additional Information
- **Privacy Policy**: Link at the bottom-left of the page

## Functionality

This interface allows vendors to:

1. **View Current Information**: See the employee's existing details
2. **Edit Employee Details**: Modify the employee's name, email, and phone number
3. **Submit Changes**: Save the updated employee information
4. **Validate Required Fields**: Ensure all required fields (marked with *) are completed

## Notes

- The interface provides a straightforward way for vendors to update employee information
- Required fields are clearly marked with asterisks (*)
- The form is pre-populated with the employee's current information
- The form structure is identical to the Create Employee form, maintaining consistency in the user experience
- Unlike the customer's edit employee form, this version does not include address information, suggesting that vendors have a simplified employee management process
- This screen is likely accessed from an employees list page or employee details page
- The form follows a clean, minimalist design consistent with other parts of the application
- The "Save" button replaces the "Create" button seen in the creation form, clearly indicating the different purpose
- The simple layout ensures that all required information is updated efficiently
- After successful update, the user is likely redirected to the employees list or the employee's details page
- This form represents an important part of ongoing employee management, allowing vendors to keep employee information current
