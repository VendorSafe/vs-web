- The interface presents a simple, clear choice between two user roles
- The options are presented as equal, prominent buttons/cards to facilitate easy selection
- The design uses visual depth (shadows) to make the options appear as clickable elements
- This screen serves as the gateway to the role-specific registration forms
- The minimalist design focuses user attention on the critical decision of role selection
- The privacy policy link is accessible but doesn't distract from the main purpose of the page
- This is likely the first screen users see after deciding to register for the system
- The clear separation of roles helps ensure users follow the correct registration path
