- Created fixed versions of API routes and controllers:
  - Added `config/routes/api/v1_questions_fixed.rb` with proper route definitions
  - Added `app/controllers/api/v1/training_questions_controller_fixed.rb` with improved error handling
  - Created `bin/apply-api-questions-fixes.sh` script to apply and test the fixes

- Created a comprehensive 10-step process for addressing Training Contents API controller issues:
  - Documented in COMPLETION_REPORT_2025-02-25-API-CONTENTS-CONTROLLERS.md
  - Outlined detailed implementation plan for fixing the issues
  - Follows the same systematic testing approach as previous controllers
  - Created a focused test file `focused_training_contents_controller_test.rb` to isolate and test the API endpoints
  - Updated `bin/run-focused-api-tests.sh` script to include the new focused test file
  - Created fixed versions of API routes and controllers:

- Developed a plan to consolidate Facilities into Locations model:
  - Created comprehensive FACILITY-TO-LOCATION-PLAN.md document
  - Identified that the existing Locations model already has hierarchical structure (parent_id)
  - Planned migration strategy to transfer data from Facilities to Locations
  - Added GeoJSON support for spatial representation of locations
  - Addressed test failures by planning updates to all affected controllers and tests
  - Documented implementation timeline with clear phases for database changes, API updates, UI implementation, and testing

- Added new golden rule to prevent future test failures:
  - Updated GOLDEN-RULES.md with best practices for using Bullet Train's super-scaffolding
  - Provided guidance on when to use super-scaffolding in the development lifecycle
  - Explained how to safely add fields after manual modifications
  - Included examples of preserving custom code during regeneration
  - Established a clear workflow to prevent conflicts between manual changes and scaffolding

- Created new Bullet Train gem for GeoJSON fields:
  - Implemented `bullet_train-fields-geojson` gem following Bullet Train conventions
  - Created proper gem structure with version, engine, and gemspec files
  - Added `has_geojson_field` concern for ActiveRecord models
  - Created Stimulus controllers for map-based input and display
  - Added view helpers and partials for GeoJSON fields
  - Designed for contribution back to the Bullet Train open source project
  - Addressed test failures related to location data by providing proper validation and helper methods
  - Prepared for PostGIS integration for advanced geospatial queries
