# Role Architecture Documentation

## Current Role Structure

### Customer
- Primary role for organizations creating and managing training programs
- Capabilities:
  * Create and edit training programs
  * Configure training settings and requirements
  * Manage vendor access and invitations
  * View analytics and reports
  * Generate certificates
  * Set up sequential progression rules

### Vendor
- Team managers or company representatives
- Capabilities:
  * View assigned training programs
  * Take training programs
  * Invite and manage team employees
  * Track team progress
  * View team certificates
  * Manage employee access

### Employee
- Individual team members taking training
- Capabilities:
  * Access training programs they're invited to
  * Complete training content sequentially
  * View their own progress
  * Earn and download certificates
  * Track personal completion status

## Pros of Current Structure

1. Clear Separation of Concerns
   - Customers focus on content creation and management
   - Vendors handle team management
   - Employees focus on learning

2. Hierarchical Access Control
   - Natural flow of permissions
   - Clear responsibility chain
   - Easy to understand who can do what

3. Team-Based Organization
   - Vendors can manage their own teams
   - Employees belong to specific vendor teams
   - Training access controlled at team level

4. Scalability
   - Supports multiple customer organizations
   - Each vendor can have multiple employees
   - Training programs can be shared across vendors

## Cons and Challenges

1. Limited Flexibility
   - Fixed hierarchy might not fit all use cases
   - Some organizations might need hybrid roles
   - Cross-team collaboration could be complex

2. Permission Granularity
   - Might need more fine-grained controls
   - Some vendors might need partial author rights
   - Special cases might need custom permissions

3. Team Structure Assumptions
   - Assumes clear vendor-employee hierarchy
   - Might not fit flat organizations
   - Could be complex for contractors

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Pros:
  * More flexible permission assignment
  * Can mix and match capabilities
  * Better for complex organizations
- Cons:
  * More complex to manage
  * Could lead to permission conflicts
  * Harder to understand structure

### 2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Pros:
  * Very flexible and dynamic
  * Can handle complex rules
  * Supports fine-grained control
- Cons:
  * Much more complex to implement
  * Higher maintenance overhead
  * Could impact performance

### 3. Multi-Tenant with Custom Roles
- Pros:
  * Each organization defines their roles
  * Maximum flexibility
  * Supports unique workflows
- Cons:
  * Complex to implement
  * Harder to maintain
  * Could lead to inconsistencies

## Future Considerations

1. Role Extensions
   - Consider adding sub-roles
   - Support for temporary permissions
   - Role delegation capabilities

2. Permission Inheritance
   - More sophisticated inheritance rules
   - Custom permission templates
   - Role composition

3. Integration Support
   - SSO role mapping
   - API access control
   - Third-party integrations

4. Audit and Compliance
   - Role change tracking
   - Permission audit logs
   - Compliance reporting

## Implementation Notes

1. Use Bullet Train's built-in role system
2. Leverage team-based organization
3. Implement role-specific validations
4. Add activity tracking for role changes
5. Support role-based notifications
6. Include role documentation in API
