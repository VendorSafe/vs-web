# Role Architecture Documentation

## Current Role Structure

The system uses four primary roles: Admin, Customer, Vendor, and Employee. These roles are designed to provide clear separation of concerns and hierarchical access control.

### Admin
- **Role:** System administrator with full access
- **Capabilities:**
  - Manage all customers, vendors, and employees
  - Create and manage training programs
  - Configure system-wide settings
  - View and manage payments history
  - Generate and manage certificates
  - Access comprehensive reports
  - Manage platform applications and API access

### Customer
- **Role:** Organization creating and managing training programs
- **Capabilities:**
  - Create and manage vendors
  - View and manage employees
  - View training list and information
  - Send training requests
  - View employee certificates
  - Access role-specific reports
  - Share and download certificates
  - Manage team profile

### Vendor
- **Role:** Team manager or company representative
- **Capabilities:**
  - Create and manage employees
  - View assigned training programs
  - Pay for training programs
  - Send training requests to employees
  - Track team progress
  - View and manage certificates
  - View training information
  - Manage team profile

### Employee
- **Role:** Individual team member taking training
- **Capabilities:**
  - View training requests
  - Take assigned training programs
  - Complete training content sequentially
  - View training results
  - Earn certificates upon completion
  - View and manage personal certificates
  - Share and download certificates
  - Manage personal profile

## Pros of Current Structure

1. Clear Separation of Concerns
   - Admin focuses on system management
   - Customers focus on vendor management
   - Vendors handle team management
   - Employees focus on learning

2. Hierarchical Access Control
   - Natural flow of permissions
   - Clear responsibility chain
   - Easy to understand who can do what

3. Team-Based Organization
   - Vendors can manage their own teams
   - Employees belong to specific vendor teams
   - Training access controlled at team level

4. Scalability
   - Supports multiple customer organizations
   - Each vendor can have multiple employees
   - Training programs can be shared across vendors

## Cons and Challenges

1. Limited Flexibility
   - Fixed hierarchy might not fit all use cases
   - Some organizations might need hybrid roles
   - Cross-team collaboration could be complex

2. Permission Granularity
   - Might need more fine-grained controls
   - Some vendors might need partial author rights
   - Special cases might need custom permissions

3. Team Structure Assumptions
   - Assumes clear vendor-employee hierarchy
   - Might not fit flat organizations
   - Could be complex for contractors

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Pros:
  * More flexible permission assignment
  * Can mix and match capabilities
  * Better for complex organizations
- Cons:
  * More complex to manage
  * Could lead to permission conflicts
  * Harder to understand structure

### 2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Pros:
  * Very flexible and dynamic
  * Can handle complex rules
  * Supports fine-grained control
- Cons:
  * Much more complex to implement
  * Higher maintenance overhead
  * Could impact performance

### 3. Multi-Tenant with Custom Roles
- Pros:
  * Each organization defines their roles
  * Maximum flexibility
  * Supports unique workflows
- Cons:
  * Complex to implement
  * Harder to maintain
  * Could lead to inconsistencies

## Future Considerations

1. Role Extensions
   - Consider adding sub-roles
   - Support for temporary permissions
   - Role delegation capabilities

2. Permission Inheritance
   - More sophisticated inheritance rules
   - Custom permission templates
   - Role composition

3. Integration Support
   - SSO role mapping
   - API access control
   - Third-party integrations

4. Audit and Compliance
   - Role change tracking
   - Permission audit logs
   - Compliance reporting

## Implementation Notes

1. Database Schema
   - User table with role field
   - Separate tables for Customer, Vendor, Employee
   - Foreign key relationships maintaining hierarchy
   - Join tables for many-to-many relationships

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Use Bullet Train's built-in role system
   - Leverage team-based organization
   - Implement role-specific validations
   - Add activity tracking for role changes

3. UI/UX Considerations
   - Role-specific dashboards
   - Context-aware navigation
   - Permission-based action visibility
   - Clear role indicators

4. API Integration
   - Role-based endpoint access
   - Scoped API responses
   - Role documentation in API specs
   - OAuth2 integration with role claims
