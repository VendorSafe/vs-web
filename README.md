# Training Program Player w/ Vue.js

The task is to integrate a Vue.js component into an existing Bullet Train Rails application to display training programs, handle user progress, and utilize JWT authentication. The provided code shows a basic Rails controller for managing training programs. We need to enhance this controller to handle API requests and the frontend to handle JWT authentication and user progress.

Overall Steps:

Backend Setup (Rails): Configure JWT authentication, create or modify API endpoints, and update the database schema.
Frontend Setup (Vue.js): Create the Vue.js component structure, install dependencies, and configure Tailwind CSS.
API Integration (Frontend): Implement API calls for fetching training program data and updating progress.
Component Implementation (Frontend): Build the VideoPlayer, QuestionsPanel, and StepProgress components.
Progress Management (Frontend/Backend): Implement mechanisms for storing and updating user progress.
Integration and Testing: Integrate the Vue component into your Rails view, test thoroughly, and address any issues.
Detailed Plan for Step 1: Backend Setup (Rails)

This step focuses on preparing the Rails backend to handle JWT authentication and API requests for training programs.

1.1 Choose a JWT Gem:

Select a suitable JWT gem for Rails (e.g., devise_token_auth, knock). devise_token_auth is a popular choice, providing a comprehensive solution including user authentication and JWT management. Install the gem using bundle add devise_token_auth.
1.2 Configure the Chosen JWT Gem:

Follow the gem's installation and configuration instructions. This typically involves:
Generating models and controllers as instructed by the gem.
Adding necessary routes for authentication (e.g., /auth/sign_in, /auth/sign_up, etc.).
Configuring database columns (if needed) to support the gem's functionality.
Adding authentication middleware to your application to verify JWTs on relevant API requests.
1.3 Modify the Account::TrainingProgramsController:

Authentication: Use the JWT gem's functionality to authenticate users before allowing API access. This would likely involve a before_action in your controller. An example using devise_token_auth:

before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:show, :update_progress] # Only these actions require authentication.
show Action: Modify the show action to include the user's progress data:

def show
  # Verify JWT authentication (if not handled by before_action)
  training_membership = current_user.training_memberships.find_by(training_program: @training_program)
  progress_data = training_membership&.progress || {} # Default to empty hash if no progress exists
  render json: @training_program.as_json(include: [:training_contents, training_contents: [:training_questions]]).merge(progress: progress_data)
end
update_progress Action: Add a new action to handle progress updates:

def update_progress
  training_membership = current_user.training_memberships.find_by(training_program: @training_program)
  if training_membership
    training_membership.update(progress: params[:progress])
    head :ok # Or send a success message
  else
    render json: { error: 'Training membership not found' }, status: :not_found
  end
end
Error Handling: Add error handling in both actions to gracefully handle issues (e.g., ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound).

Authorization: Add authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can access training programs and update their progress. (Use Pundit or CanCanCan).

1.4 Update Database Schema:

Add a progress column (JSONB data type) to the training_memberships table if it doesn't exist already:

class AddProgressToTrainingMemberships < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def change
    add_column :training_memberships, :progress, :jsonb, default: {}
  end
end
Run this migration using bin/rails db:migrate

1.5 Define API Routes: Modify your config/routes.rb to include the API routes for your Account::TrainingProgramsController:

namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do # Versioning is recommended
    resources :training_programs, only: [:show] do
      member do
        put :update_progress
      end
    end
  end
end
1.6 Testing: Write tests to validate the authentication, authorization, and functionality of the API endpoints.

This completes the backend setup. The next step involves setting up the frontend Vue.js component. Remember to restart your Rails server after making changes to the database or routes.

-----

Step 2: Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

This step focuses on setting up the necessary Vue.js project structure, installing dependencies, and configuring Tailwind CSS for styling. Because you're integrating this into an existing Rails application, we'll assume you're using Webpacker or a similar asset pipeline.

2.1 Project Setup (Within Rails):

Create a directory: Create a directory within your Rails application's app/javascript directory (e.g., app/javascript/training-program-viewer). This will contain all your Vue.js files.

Create main component: Inside the directory, create the main component file (TrainingProgramViewer.vue):

<template>
  <div>
    <!-- Your component content will go here -->
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
  // Your Vue.js logic will go here
</script>
Create other component files: Create other components (VideoPlayer.vue, QuestionsPanel.vue, StepProgress.vue) within the same directory following similar template structure.

2.2 Install Dependencies (via npm or yarn):

Navigate to your app/javascript directory in the terminal.
Install the required packages using npm or yarn. Use npm install or yarn add to install the packages:
axios: For making HTTP requests to your Rails API.
@formkit/vue: For building forms.
@headlessui/vue: For UI components.
@tailwindcss/forms: For Tailwind CSS form styles.
pinia: Vuex-like state management.
vue-use-cloudinary: For Cloudinary video integration. (Alternatives exist).
@vueuse/motion: For animations (optional).
zod: For runtime type validation of data.
2.3 Configure Tailwind CSS:

If your Rails app doesn't already use Tailwind CSS, you'll need to integrate it. This is generally done via a gem like tailwindcss-rails.

Important: Ensure Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and includes your Vue.js components in the content section of your tailwind.config.js. You may need to adjust the paths to accurately point to your Vue.js components. An example tailwind.config.js snippet:

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/views/**/*.html.erb", // Add your Rails views here
    "./app/javascript/**/*.vue" // Add your Vue.js components here
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Run the necessary commands to build and include the Tailwind CSS output in your application (as detailed in the documentation for your chosen gem). You'll likely need to run a command like rails tailwindcss:install followed by rails tailwindcss:setup and potentially others to generate necessary files and add Tailwind directives to your CSS.

2.4 Set up Pinia Stores:

Create Pinia stores (e.g., useAuthStore.js, useTrainingProgramStore.js) within your app/javascript/training-program-viewer directory to manage your application's state. These will likely live in separate files.

// useAuthStore.js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', {
  state: () => ({
    token: null,
    user: null,
  }),
  actions: {
    setToken(token) {
      this.token = token;
    },
    setUser(user) {
      this.user = user;
    },
  },
});


// useTrainingProgramStore.js
import { defineStore } from 'pinia';
import axios from 'axios';

export const useTrainingProgramStore = defineStore('trainingProgram', {
  state: () => ({
      trainingProgram: null,
      isLoading: false,
      error: null,
  }),
  actions: {
      async fetchTrainingProgram(id) {
          this.isLoading = true;
          this.error = null;
          try {
              const response = await axios.get(`/api/v1/training_programs/${id}`);
              this.trainingProgram = response.data;
          } catch (error) {
              this.error = error;
          } finally {
              this.isLoading = false;
          }
      },
      updateProgress(progressData) {
          // ... (Implementation for updating progress)
      }
  },
});
2.5 Import and use Pinia: In your TrainingProgramViewer.vue component, import and use the Pinia stores:

<script setup>
import { useAuthStore } from './useAuthStore';
import { useTrainingProgramStore } from './useTrainingProgramStore';
const authStore = useAuthStore();
const trainingProgramStore = useTrainingProgramStore();

onMounted(async () => {
    await trainingProgramStore.fetchTrainingProgram(1); // Replace 1 with the actual ID
});
</script>

2.6 Webpacker Configuration (If Necessary):

If your Rails application uses Webpacker, ensure that your Vue.js component is properly included in your webpack configuration. This might involve adding an entry point for your Vue component.
This detailed plan will get your frontend project up and running, ready for API integration. Remember to test the functionality of your stores. You'll likely need to adjust paths based on your project structure.



-----

Step 3: API Integration (Frontend)

This step focuses on implementing the Axios calls within your Vue.js components to interact with the Rails API endpoints created in Step 1. We'll leverage the Pinia stores created in Step 2 to manage the data and state.

3.1 Setting up Axios Interceptors (for JWT Authentication):

Create an Axios instance in a separate file (axiosInstance.js within your app/javascript/training-program-viewer directory), which will handle adding the JWT token to every request.

import axios from 'axios';
import { useAuthStore } from './useAuthStore';

const axiosInstance = axios.create();

axiosInstance.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    const authStore = useAuthStore();
    const token = authStore.token;
    if (token) {
      config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
    }
    return config;
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
);

export default axiosInstance;
Import and use axiosInstance instead of axios directly in your Pinia actions.

3.2 useTrainingProgramStore Actions (Enhancements):

fetchTrainingProgram(id): This action should fetch training program data using axiosInstance.

import axiosInstance from './axiosInstance';
import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

export const useTrainingProgramStore = defineStore('trainingProgram', {
  // ... (state remains the same)

  actions: {
    async fetchTrainingProgram(id) {
      this.isLoading = true;
      this.error = null;
      try {
        const response = await axiosInstance.get(`/api/v1/training_programs/${id}`);
        this.trainingProgram = response.data;
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors appropriately (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, network errors)
        this.error = error.response?.data || error.message;  //Extract error message if possible
        console.error("Error fetching training program:", error);
      } finally {
        this.isLoading = false;
      }
    },
    async updateProgress(id, progressData) {
      this.isLoading = true;
      this.error = null;
      try {
        const response = await axiosInstance.put(`/api/v1/training_programs/${id}/update_progress`, { progress: progressData });
        // Handle success, update local state if necessary
        console.log('Progress updated successfully:', response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        this.error = error.response?.data || error.message;
        console.error("Error updating progress:", error);
      } finally {
        this.isLoading = false;
      }
    }
  },
});
updateProgress(id, progressData): This action sends a PUT request to /api/v1/training_programs/:id/update_progress using axiosInstance.

3.3 JWT Handling in useAuthStore:

The useAuthStore needs methods to handle JWT acquisition and storage:

import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

export const useAuthStore = defineStore('auth', {
  state: () => ({
    token: null, //JWT token
    user: null, //User data after login.  You would likely add properties like userId, etc.
  }),
  actions: {
    setToken(token) {
      this.token = token;
      localStorage.setItem('token', token); //Save to local storage (Consider more secure alternatives)
    },
    setUser(user) {
      this.user = user;
      localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user)); //Store user data.
    },
    async login(credentials) {
      // make POST request to your rails authentication endpoint (e.g., /auth/sign_in)
      try {
        const response = await axios.post('/auth/sign_in', credentials); //replace with correct path
        this.setToken(response.headers['access-token']);
        this.setUser(response.data); //set the user data.
        return true; //indicate success
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Login failed:', error);
        return false;
      }
    },
    logout() {
      this.token = null;
      this.user = null;
      localStorage.removeItem('token');
      localStorage.removeItem('user');
    },
  },
});

3.4 Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling in your try...catch blocks in both Pinia actions. Check the error response status codes (401, 404, 500, etc.) and display appropriate messages to the user. Use a centralized error handling mechanism if possible.
3.5 Integration with TrainingProgramViewer.vue:

The TrainingProgramViewer.vue component should call the fetchTrainingProgram action from useTrainingProgramStore on mount. It should also call updateProgress whenever the progress changes.
This detailed plan guides you through integrating the Axios API calls, incorporating JWT authentication, and managing errors effectively within your Vue.js components. Remember to replace placeholder URLs and handle potential errors appropriately. Consider using a more secure method than localStorage for JWT storage in a production application. Also, remember to handle all potential error responses.

-----

Step 4: Component Implementation (Frontend)

This step focuses on building the individual Vue.js components: VideoPlayer.vue, QuestionsPanel.vue, and StepProgress.vue. These components will receive data as props from the TrainingProgramViewer.vue component and will handle the presentation of the training program's content, questions, and progress.

4.1 VideoPlayer.vue:

Props: This component will receive a videoUrl prop (from Cloudinary, likely). It might also receive other props like onVideoEnded to signal video completion.

Template: The template will use a <video> tag to display the video. Consider using a library to handle video playback controls if needed (though native controls are often sufficient).

Script: This component's script section will handle event listeners for the video element. The onVideoEnded event should emit an event or call a function to update the progress in the useTrainingProgramStore. Example:

<template>
  <video ref="videoPlayer" :src="videoUrl" controls @ended="onVideoEnded">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { ref, defineProps, defineEmits } from 'vue';

  const props = defineProps({
    videoUrl: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  });

  const emit = defineEmits(['videoEnded']);

  const videoPlayer = ref(null);

  const onVideoEnded = () => {
    emit('videoEnded');
  };
</script>
4.2 QuestionsPanel.vue:

Props: This component receives a questions prop (array of question objects) and potentially a slideId prop for identifying the current slide.

Template: The template will iterate through the questions array and render each question using @formkit/vue. Ensure the template dynamically renders different question types (multiple choice, etc.).

Script: The script handles form submission using @formkit/vue's methods. On successful submission, it should update progress within the useTrainingProgramStore. It should also handle error scenarios. Example (using simplified question structure):

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent="onSubmit">
    <div v-for="(question, index) in questions" :key="index">
      <FormKit type="text" :name="question.id" label="question.title" />
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Submit Answers</button>
  </form>
</template>

<script setup>
  import { ref, defineProps, defineEmits } from 'vue';
  import { useTrainingProgramStore } from './useTrainingProgramStore';

  const trainingProgramStore = useTrainingProgramStore();
  const props = defineProps({
    questions: {
      type: Array,
      required: true,
    },
    slideId: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    }
  });

  const onSubmit = async () => {
    const answers = {};
    //Collect answers using FormKit's methods
    await trainingProgramStore.updateProgress(slideId, answers);
  };
</script>
4.3 StepProgress.vue:

Props: This component receives totalSlides and currentSlide props.

Template: The template will render a progress bar or a set of steps using @headlessui/vue. This can be implemented using HeadlessUI's Stepper or Tabs component, depending on the desired look and feel.

Script: No significant logic is required in the script. It simply displays the progress based on the props.

4.4 Data Structures:

Ensure your question data is formatted correctly for use with @formkit/vue. Also, ensure consistency between your frontend and backend data structures.

4.5 Integration with TrainingProgramViewer.vue:

The TrainingProgramViewer.vue component will pass the necessary data (video URL, questions, slide index, total slides) as props to these individual components. It will also listen for events emitted from child components (like videoEnded from VideoPlayer) to update the progress in the Pinia store.

This detailed plan breaks down the implementation of each component, highlighting essential props, templates, and scripts. Remember that the complexity of these components will depend on the specific features and design of your training program viewer. Always test these components thoroughly.


-----


Step 5: Progress Management (Frontend/Backend)

This step focuses on implementing the mechanisms for storing and updating user progress. It involves coordinating the frontend's progress updates with the backend's data storage.

5.1 Frontend Progress Data Structure:

Define a consistent data structure for storing progress in your useTrainingProgramStore. This structure must match the progress column's JSONB format in your Rails database (from Step 1). Here's a suggested structure:

// In useTrainingProgramStore.js
state: () => ({
  trainingProgram: null,
  isLoading: false,
  error: null,
  progress: { // This object holds the progress data.
    currentSlide: 0,
    completedSlides: [], // Array of completed slide IDs
    answers: {}, // answers: { "slideId": { "questionId": "answer" } }
    score: 0,
  },
}),
5.2 Frontend Progress Update Logic:

useTrainingProgramStore.updateProgress Action: This action (already partially implemented in Step 3) needs to be completed. It should take the updated progress object as an argument.

// ... inside useTrainingProgramStore actions

async updateProgress(id, progressData) {
    this.isLoading = true;
    this.error = null;
    try {
        const response = await axiosInstance.put(`/api/v1/training_programs/${id}/update_progress`, { progress: progressData });
        // Update local progress state AFTER successful API call:
        this.progress = { ...this.progress, ...progressData}; //Merge new progress with existing
        console.log('Progress updated successfully:', response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        this.error = error.response?.data || error.message;
        console.error("Error updating progress:", error);
    } finally {
        this.isLoading = false;
    }
}

Triggering Updates: In your VideoPlayer.vue and QuestionsPanel.vue components, emit events or call updateProgress when appropriate:

VideoPlayer.vue: Call updateProgress when the video ends (onVideoEnded). You'll need to update the currentSlide and potentially the completedSlides in the progress object before calling updateProgress.
QuestionsPanel.vue: Call updateProgress after successful answer submission. Update the answers and score properties accordingly. You might also add completedSlides here if the slide is considered complete upon answer submission.
5.3 Backend Progress Handling:

The backend (Account::TrainingProgramsController#update_progress action) should handle updating the progress JSONB column in the training_memberships table. You'll likely need to use ActiveRecord's methods to update the JSONB data. Error handling is critical here to prevent data corruption. Consider adding validations to ensure the data being updated conforms to your progress schema. Use a gem like strong_parameters for this.
5.4 Data Consistency:

Ensure that the data structure of the progress object in your frontend code is perfectly consistent with the database schema and how the data is serialized by your Rails controller. Any discrepancies can lead to data loss or errors.
5.5 Testing:

Thoroughly test the progress update mechanism. Verify that changes in the frontend are accurately reflected in the database and vice-versa. Write unit and integration tests to cover various scenarios (successful updates, error handling, etc.).
This plan outlines the crucial aspects of progress management. Remember to handle errors gracefully, implement data validations, and thoroughly test your solution at every stage. Using a consistent data structure across frontend and backend is paramount to avoid data inconsistencies.



-----


Step 6: Integration and Testing

This final step involves integrating the completed Vue.js component into your Rails application and conducting thorough testing.

6.1 Integration with Rails View:

Webpacker Setup (If Applicable): Ensure your Vue.js component is correctly configured within your Rails application's asset pipeline (Webpacker). If you haven't already, you'll need to ensure that your Vue component is correctly packaged and accessible from your Rails views.

View Template: Modify the relevant ERB (or other) template file in your Rails application where you want to display the training program viewer. Import the Vue component and render it. The exact method depends on how you've structured your Vue app and whether you use a dedicated component library (e.g., Stimulus). Here's a possible example (assuming a basic setup without a framework like Stimulus):

<%= javascript_pack_tag 'training-program-viewer' %>
<div id="training-program-viewer"></div>
This assumes you have created a pack (training-program-viewer) to bundle your Vue.js components.

Data Passing (Optional): If you need to pass data to the Vue component from your Rails view, you can pass it as attributes to a <div> element, or create a global variable accessible to both the Rails views and your Vue component (use carefully).

6.2 Testing:

Unit Tests (Frontend): Use a testing framework like Jest or Cypress to test the individual Vue.js components in isolation. These tests should verify the functionality of each component, including data handling, event emissions, and rendering.

Integration Tests (Frontend): Test the interaction between your components. For example, ensure the VideoPlayer correctly emits events when the video ends, and the QuestionsPanel updates the progress correctly after submission.

API Tests (Frontend): Test the API calls using tools like Cypress or other end-to-end testing frameworks. Ensure your API calls are working correctly and returning the expected responses.

Controller Tests (Backend): Test your Rails controller's actions. These tests should verify that your JWT authentication works correctly, your API responses are correct, your data validations are in place, and that the progress updates in the database are properly handled.

Integration Tests (Backend): Test the integration between your frontend and backend. Ensure that the frontend can successfully send and receive data from the backend. Tools like Capybara can help simulate browser actions and test overall functionality.

6.3 Error Handling:

Frontend Error Handling: The frontend should gracefully handle errors from API calls. Display user-friendly messages when errors occur (e.g., network errors, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

Backend Error Handling: The backend should handle errors appropriately and return informative error messages. Use proper HTTP status codes to indicate error types.

6.4 Deployment:

Asset Pipeline: Ensure your Vue.js code is correctly bundled and served by your Rails application.

Server-Side Rendering (Optional): If you need server-side rendering, you'll need to configure your Rails app to render the Vue.js component on the server.

This final step is crucial. Thorough testing is the only way to ensure the reliability and correctness of your integrated application. Remember to address any issues that arise during testing and iterate on your implementation until it functions flawlessly.

Additional Notes:

Additional Pointers and Notes for Training Program Viewer Integration
This section includes additional considerations and recommendations to ensure a successful integration of the Vue.js training program viewer into your Bullet Train Rails application.

I. Frontend Considerations:

State Management: While Pinia is chosen, consider the complexity of your application. For very large applications, a more robust state management solution might be necessary.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling in your Vue components. This includes handling network errors, API errors (401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, etc.), and validation errors from @formkit/vue. Use a consistent error display mechanism throughout your application.
Security: Avoid storing sensitive information like JWTs directly in localStorage. Explore secure alternatives like using HTTPOnly cookies managed by your Rails backend.
Responsiveness: Ensure your Vue components are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes. Tailwind CSS should help with this, but you might need to add specific responsive classes.
Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility best practices when designing your components. Use ARIA attributes and semantic HTML where appropriate. Headless UI should assist with this.
Loading States: Display clear loading indicators while fetching data or submitting answers. This improves the user experience.
Internationalization (i18n): Consider adding internationalization support if your application needs to support multiple languages.
Testing Strategy: Implement a robust testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
II. Backend Considerations:

API Versioning: Implement API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/training_programs) to allow for future changes to your API without breaking existing clients.
Authentication Security: Secure your JWT authentication. Use HTTPS, and carefully consider using refresh tokens to extend the lifetime of user sessions without compromising security.
Authorization: Use a gem like Pundit or CanCanCan to implement fine-grained authorization controls. Ensure that users only have access to the data they should have access to.
Data Validation: Validate all data received from the frontend before persisting it to the database. Use strong parameters or similar mechanisms to avoid mass-assignment vulnerabilities.
Database Optimization: For large training programs or a high volume of users, optimize your database queries and schema to improve performance.
Logging: Implement proper logging to track API requests, errors, and other important events.
III. Integration Considerations:

Asset Pipeline: Ensure that your Vue.js assets are correctly included in your Rails asset pipeline (Webpacker) and are properly served to the client. Test thoroughly on your deployment environment.
Rails View Integration: Use a clean and maintainable way to integrate the Vue component into your Rails view. Consider using a component library (like Stimulus) to manage the interaction between the frontend and the backend.
Data Serialization: Ensure that the data serialization from your Rails API is consistent with the expected data structure in your Vue components. Use ActiveModelSerializers to effectively control this.
Deployment: Test your entire application thoroughly on your deployment environment before releasing it to production.
IV. Specific to Bullet Train:

Authentication Integration: Carefully integrate the JWT authentication with Bullet Train's existing authentication system.
Theme Integration: Ensure your Vue component styling integrates seamlessly with your chosen Bullet Train theme.
Existing Models: Use your existing models and associations effectively. Avoid redundancy.
By carefully considering these additional points, you can significantly improve the quality, security, and maintainability of your integrated application. Remember that iterative development and thorough testing are essential for success.
