I'll help modify the structure to accommodate flexible pricing models in Bullet Train Rails style.

Create a new model for pricing details:

Generate the scaffolding:

Create a model for tracking payment responsibilities:

Generate the scaffolding:

Update the training request model:

Add the associations to the training program:

This implementation:

Supports multiple pricing strategies
Allows for group discounts
Tracks payment responsibilities
Handles different payment scenarios
Integrates with Bullet Train's team system
Maintains audit trails through PublicActivity
Would you like me to detail the views and controllers for managing these pricing structures?

Explain how you interpret the different roles in their explanation and wirefreames and my implementation so far.

Role Analysis: Udoras vs Current Implementation
Original Udoras Roles
From the database structure and wireframes:

Current Bullet Train Implementation
Proposed Merged Structure
Role-Specific Profile Models
Key Differences and Improvements
Role Hierarchy

Udoras: Flat role structure
Bullet Train: Team-based with role assignments
Merged: Team-based with polymorphic profiles
Access Control

Udoras: Table-based (user_customers, user_vendors, etc.)
Bullet Train: Permission-based
Merged: Permission-based with role-specific features
Team Management

Training Flow

Udoras: Direct relationships between users
Bullet Train: Team-scoped relationships
Merged: Team-scoped with role-specific workflows
Permission Structure

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific role's implementation or the permission structure?

# Architectural Decisions and Updates

## Location Model (replacing Facility)
- Changed from Facility to Location to better align with industry standards
- Implemented hierarchical structure to support:
  - Multiple facilities on a single property
  - Different types of units (plants, offices, warehouses)
  - Complex organizational structures
- Rationale:
  - Matches patterns in ISNetworld and BROWZ
  - Provides more flexibility for large organizations
  - Enables better location-specific training requirements

## Pricing Model Implementation
- Added flexible pricing system with:
  - Fixed price option for standard training
  - Variable pricing with volume discounts
  - Team-scoped pricing strategies
- Benefits:
  - Supports different business models
  - Enables bulk training discounts
  - Maintains pricing consistency within teams

## Technical Improvements
- Enhanced real-time updates using CableReady:
  - Location changes reflect immediately
  - Pricing updates show in real-time
  - Training program modifications sync automatically
- Team-based multitenancy improvements:
  - Strict validation of parent-child relationships
  - Team-scoped pricing models
  - Enhanced security for cross-team access

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing location-specific training requirements
- Explore advanced pricing strategies (seasonal, promotional)
- Add support for location-based reporting and analytics
Would you like me to elaborate on how this integrates with the role-based access control or show examples of location-specific training requirements?
