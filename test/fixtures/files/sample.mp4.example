This is a placeholder for a sample video file. In a real application, you would:

1. Create a real MP4 file with minimal size (1-2 seconds)
2. Add it to version control
3. Use it for testing video playback functionality

For now, tests will create an empty file if this example file is not replaced with a real video file.

Note: When implementing in production:
- Replace this file with a real MP4 file
- Keep the file size small (< 1MB) to avoid bloating the repository
- Consider using a standardized test video (e.g., Big Buck Bunny test clip)
- Ensure the video has no audio to avoid test environment issues
